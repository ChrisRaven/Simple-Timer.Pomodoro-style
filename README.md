**1. Download FASM**: Go to the official [Flat Assembler website](flatassembler.net) and download the latest version of FASM for Windows (e.g., fasmw.zip). Extract the archive to a folder, which will contain fasm.exe and the include files like win32a.inc.

**2. Save the code**: Download the timer.asm file and put it in the main directory of FASM.

**3. Compile the code**: Open a command prompt (CMD) and navigate to the folder containing timer.asm and fasm.exe. Run the following command:

```cmd
fasm timer.asm timer.exe
```

This will assemble the code and produce timer.exe.

Run the application: Double-click timer.exe to launch the timer app. It should create a small window (about 200x100 pixels client area) that stays on top. Click "START" to begin the countdown, "RESET" to reset it, and it will flash the time in red when it reaches 00:00.
